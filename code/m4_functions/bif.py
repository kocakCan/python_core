      similarly.

    breakpoint(*args, **kws)

    - This function drops you into the debugger at the call site. Specifically,

    - By default, sys.breakpointhook() calls pdb.set_trace() expecting no
      arguments. In this case, it is purely a convenience function so you don't
      have to explicitly import pdb or type as much code to enter the debugger.
    - However, sys.breakpointhook() can be set to some other function and
      breakpoint() will automatically call that, allowing you to drop into the
      debugger of choice.

      <= 256. It has the most of the usual methods of mutable sequences, as
      well as most methods that the bytes type has.
    - If it is a string, you must also give the encoding (and optionally,
      errors) parameters; bytearray() then converts the string to bytes using
      str.encode()
    - If it is an integer, the array will have that size and will be
      initialized with null bytes.
    - If it is an object conforming to the buffer interface, a read-only buffer
      of the object will be used as the initial contents of the array.

    - bytes is an immutable version of bytearry - it has the same non-mutating

    @classmethod

    - Transform a method into a class method.
    - A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just
      like an instance method receives the instance.
    - To declare a class method, use this idiom:

      class C:
      @classmethod
      def f(cls, arg1, arg2): ...

    - The @classmethod form is a function decorator.
    - A class method can be called either on the class (such as C.f()) or on an
      instance (such as C().f()). The instance is ignored except for its class.
      If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class object
      is passed as the implied first argument.
    - Class methods are different than C++ and Java static methods. If it's
      what you're looking for, then use @staticmethod.

      argument; however, there is a standard formatting syntax that is used by
      most built-in types.
