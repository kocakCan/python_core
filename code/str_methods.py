# strip([chars]) - Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.

# zfill(width) - Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII '0' digits to make a string of length width. A leading sign prefix ('+', '-') is handled by inserting hte padding after the sign character rather than before. The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).
